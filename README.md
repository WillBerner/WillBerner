👋 Hi, I’m @WillBerner, a Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments and 2020 Computer Science B.S. Graduate from UNC Chapel Hill. 😁😎

👨‍💻 If you've interacted with the Netbenefits Homepage with Fidelity at www.NetBenefits.com, you've probably used my code! ⚙️

🏢👀 Basically all of the code I write is on my private Fidelity GitHub account, so can't be shown here unfortunately ❌🙈

📫 If you'd like to contact me, please reach out to my personal email: will.o.berner@gmail.com.
