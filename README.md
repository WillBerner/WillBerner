Hi, Iâ€™m @WillBerner, a Full Stack Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments and 2020 Computer Science B.S. Graduate from UNC Chapel Hill. 

I write a ton of code, but none of it is visible on my personal GitHub account here, unfortunately. If you've interacted with the Netbenefits Homepage through Fidelity at www.NetBenefits.com, you've probably used my code though! I love web development and also have a bit of a soft spot for algorithms.

If you'd like to contact me, please reach out to my personal email: will.o.berner@gmail.com.
